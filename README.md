# PhotoTalk
An iOS and MacOS Swift app for reviewing large quantities of photos - correct location and date

For each photo, users can...
- Edit the date (year required -- month and day optional)
- Edit the location (pop-up list of prior entries makes this easier)
- Add a text comment
- Add a voice annotation up to 5 minutes long
- Add a "favorite" tag
- Add a "forget this photo" tag (to delete in the future)

Assumptions (in this version):
- Photos are scanned and stored in cloud on iCloud or Google Drive
- Photo info is stored in a Google Sheet

Planned feature improvements:
- Enable speech-to-text for easier annotation.  Pull date and location info from voice annotation ("This is a photo of the kids in 1972 in Glendale...")
- Use fast database as back-end (Firebase or other dBase)
- Support other storage services (Google Drive, Amazon Photos, etc.)
- Auto-import photos into local photo storage (Apple or Google Photos)
- Enable a video "slide show" playing each photo with a "Ken Burns" effect with narration voiceover
